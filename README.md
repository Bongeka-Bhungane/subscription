### What I learned

- JavaScript is not my strong point, so I used Codecademy to help me sharpern my skills and come up with this code:
```ipt>
            // get the sign up button 
            const signUpButton= document.getElementById ('signUpButton');

            // add an event listener to the button
            signUpButton.addEventListener('click', () => {

            //display a confirmation message 
            alert('Thank you for signing up!');
             });  
```

### future development

- add server-side functionality to handle sign-up requests
- integrate with a database to store user information
- enhance the design and features to improve user experience

### code structure

the code contains:
- HTML: provides the structure and content of the webpage
- CSS: styles the webpage with a clean and responsive design
JavaScript: adds functionality to the sign-up button, displaying a confirmation message when clicked

### useage 
- use the sign-up button to trigger the JavaScript functionality
- view the webpage in different screen sizes to see the resposive design in action

### Useful resources
